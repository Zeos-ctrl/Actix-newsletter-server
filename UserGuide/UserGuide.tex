Newsman is a command line program that allows you to construct a mailing list and send 
out newsletters to the people on that list. It can work attached to the terminal 
or detached as a daemon and run as a background process!

\section{Installation}
Newsman can be installed from source for anyone familiar with that process,
a database must also be constructed in order to complete the installation.
The database schema can be found in the git repo under mailing\_list.sql and 
\textbf{MUST BE INSTALLED INTO A DATABASE BASED ON MYSQL} because at the moment 
thats the only supported database type, i.e, mariadb. After installing 
the package a config file should have been created called 
.config/newsman/newsman.toml this file contains all the information
needed by the program to work, this includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item url: This is the database url, for example 
        mysql://root:password@localhost/emails 
    \item dir: This is the directory the newsletters are stored in,
        it defaults to .config/newsman/newsletters/
    \item smtp\_username: This is the username for the smtp client such as, 
        example@mail.com.
    \item smtp\_password: This is the password for the email.
    \item sender: Should be the same as smtp\_username.
    \item relay: Your smtp relay for example, mail.example.com.
\end{itemize}

\section{Usage}
Newsman comes with multiple flag options which can be found with the newsman -h 
command:

\begin{itemize}
    \item -a (Email) Adds an email to the mailing list.
    \item -r (Email) Removes an email from the mailing list.
    \item -j (Newsletter Name) Starts a mailing job for a specified newsletter. 
    \item -t (Time) Time to delay the newsletter from being sent, defaults to 
        0s.
    \item -e (Execute) Executes all mailing jobs, given true or false.
    \item -d (Daemon) Runs the program as a daemon, given true or false. 
    \item -\-debug Turns debugging information on.
    \item -h, -\-help (Help) Prints help.
    \item -V, -\-version (Version) Prints version.
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributing}
When contributing to this project make sure to follow these steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Open an issue with your planned change
    \item Make a branch for your change
    \item Make your change following the projects structure
    \item Open a pull request to merge your branch
\end{itemize}

These steps ensure the software doesn't suffer from feature creep and keeps the 
codebase as clean as possible. When writing the code make sure it follows Rust 
best practices as well as being placed in an appropriate file. For example if 
you write a function for handling emails make sure it's in the emails.rs file. 
If adding a new type of function make a new file in the src directory 
called \textbf{\textit{function.rs}}, where function is whatever your function 
relates to. Any tests should be written at the bottom of the that functions file.
